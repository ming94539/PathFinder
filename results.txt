Owning day to day relationships with some of our analytics vendors.
Developing new systems and/or tools that help IGN process, interpret, and provide insights from our vast variety of data sources.
What will get you in the door?

hygiene, analysis and presentation, and the various forms of math required to do so.

(Recent school experience acceptable)
Experience working with Excel and Google Sheets. Bonus points for experience with R,SQL, SPSS or business intelligence applications such as Mode or Looker.

Excellent written and verbal communication skills, of course, but also the ability to distill
complex, nuanced insights into easily digestible formats for a wide variety of audiences.
Comfortable with public speaking and presenting your ideas to others.
Must be self-motivated, able to manage and prioritize workload and meet deadlines.
Attention to detail and a “measure twice, cut once” mentality.
You have a passion for games or entertainment related to the gaming audience.
Here’s the good stuff about us…
You’ll make an impact. We reach 250MM unique users each month. We’re big time, but
we are a small team — and we’re not afraid to give you real opportunities to make a

difference in grand, visible ways.
Gaming, Movies and TV are the culture here. That means it’s actually fun, even when we’re not trying. We share the same passions as our audience, and want to be here.
We value irreverence. We want you to be yourself, speak your mind, lead shenanigans,
and know that nothing here is above question.
There is value in games and entertainment. We’re the experts and we’re preparing for a
future where gaming is everywhere.

Come geek out with us, but be prepared to work as hard as you play. It’s serious business, after all.

High-impact software development jobs for smart people.

Code that saves lives.

As a software developer at Epic, you’ll write software that impacts the lives of 75% of Americans and 250 million patients around the world. Working in your own office, surrounded by thousands of high-caliber developers, you’ll use modern development methodologies and employ user-centered design, analytics, and machine learning tools to drive innovation in healthcare. Using leading-edge technologies and languages like JS, TS, and C#, you’ll invent better ways to reduce medical errors, streamline record sharing between hospitals, and provide the quality of care a patient deserves.

Write software for the most innovative health systems on the planet.

The top 15 health systems in U.S. News and World Report are Epic customers. Our community includes major systems like the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Clinic, and Kaiser Permanente, as well as leading academic medical centers at the University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan, University of California, University of Texas, The Ohio State University, and many more.

Work in your own office, eat delicious food, and travel the world.

We don’t believe in cubicles. (Well, we believe they exist, but…) You will work in an individual office that will heighten your ability to get stuff done. For lunch, visit King’s Cross or Cassiopeia for a wide array of meal options, or go to one of our smaller, themed bistros, featuring wood-rotisserie, pan-Asian, and Latin-inspired cuisine. All meals are restaurant-quality but cost only a few dollars, and they’re prepared by a team comprised of kitchen talent from restaurants around the country. And, after five years here, you’ll earn a four-week sabbatical anywhere in the world. Staff have kayaked in Patagonia, attended a Beyoncé concert in Ireland, built a library in Tanzania, and run a marathon in Antarctica.

Live affordably in a city known for its rising tech talent.

Epic is located just outside Madison, Wisconsin the second fastest growing market for tech talent in the United States and home to the state capital and the University of Wisconsin. Madison, a city surrounded by water, has received accolades for being the greenest city in America (NerdWallet), the best city for renters (SmartAsset), fittest city in America (Fitbit), and, for the gamers, is one of a handful of US cities to have a Killer Queen arcade game, located at Madison’s first arcade bar.

More than just important work.

We offer comprehensive benefits to keep you healthy and happy as you grow in your life and career, and your merit-based compensation will reflect the impact your work has on the company and our customers. You'll also be eligible for annual raises and bonuses, as well as stock grants, which give you an even greater stake in the success of Epic and our customers. Epic is an Equal Opportunity employer.
