Say hello to a Wider World. WideOrbit helps media companies do more business by making it easier to complete more sales. We build the one platform that ties everything together – from TV, radio, and digital ad sales, to reporting, invoicing, and payments. Chances are if there’s an ad on your local TV or radio station, or on your favorite streaming service or podcast, we helped put it there. Our customers include NBCUniversal, AMC Networks, ViacomCBS, A+E Networks, Hearst Media, and many more industry leaders around the world.

At WideOrbit, we make preserving our inclusive environment an ongoing priority, empowering team members to contribute at every level, in every function. We hire high-energy innovators who value diversity, unafraid to wield their passion and expertise to advocate for our customers and each other. At WideOrbit, you’ll make a difference and see your impact every day, while learning, growing, and enjoying what you do!
 Job Description:
As our Software Engineer, you will be a major contributor to a small, experienced team. You will work on our next-generation streaming media and podcasting solutions and your code will make an impact on the product. We build powerful web services, complex data pipelines, and modern UI. You’ll have a chance to focus on areas you’re already skilled in and take on new challenges over time. Our distributed team has a fun and inclusive environment with a commitment to work-life balance.
 What it’s like to work on this team:
Start your day with coffee in your own home office. Write some code before lunch, and then take a break. You can catch up on some reading, join in one of our occasional lunch gaming sessions, or learn something that interests you through your provided Udemy and Pluralsight accounts. Finish the code you’re working on, update tests, and if you finish a feature submit a PR. Then checkout by 5. We work to live, not the other way around, and we encourage healthy working hours.
We are developers and we understand what developers need.  We’ll provide you with a work environment where collaboration is encouraged but you’re not bombarded with superfluous interruptions. We have highly encouraged quiet times each afternoon so that everyone can focus without worrying they’re missing anything. We work in modern agile feature teams that self-organize and work together to build great software. You’ll have the opportunity to contribute new ideas, learn new technologies, and build new features. Our friendly code reviews make us all better and you get to be a part of that by both reviewing codes and having yours reviewed. We have fun doing what we do, and you will too.
 Here is what success will look like:
Designing and developing enterprise-level web service software solutions
Building fresh, dynamic interfaces in ReactJS
Defining testing requirements, and authoring Unit and Behavioral cases plus working alongside QA to ensure quality
Participating in Tech Spikes and Feasibility studies to help flesh out new ideas and unknowns
Partnering with development, product support, QA, and other DAS teams to make the best product we can
Acquiring new skills, broadening existing skills, and contributing to others through knowledge sharing – we are better together
       To thrive in this role, we’re looking for:
You possess 4+ years’ experience writing quality modern web apps in PHP or GoLang 
You understand that services need to scale, and you take pride in making sure yours do so commendably
You enjoy creating modern UI in JavaScript and are interested in working in React
You’re enthusiastic about the power of databases and have experience with MySQL or a similar technology
You’ll contribute your awesome verbal and written communication skills
You take ownership of the things you build. You look at everything with a critical eye, and fixing a bug is as satisfying as adding a great new feature (You’ll get to do both!)
You work well with competing tasks, and if things change, you pivot quickly and execute smoothly
If you have experience in the radio broadcast or streaming industry, that’s a plus
Degree in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent practical experience
 Other things we do that you could contribute to:
Docker, C#, Cassandra, Big Query, AWS, and GCP technologies
Powerful dynamic ad decisioning engines
Advanced data reporting and forecasting
Audio engineering
Best in class streaming audio tools

Location:
This is a telecommute / remote position. If you’re located near Vancouver, WA, it's a plus.

Compensation, Benefits, and Perks:

About Opentrons
Currently, over 90% of biologists in the world run experiments with manual pipettes, moving tiny amounts of liquid from vial to vial by hand. That’s why Opentrons makes robots for biologists that are 10x cheaper and easier to use than any lab automation before. Our robots automate experiments that would otherwise be done by hand so our users can spend less time pipetting and more time pursuing answers to the 21st century’s most important questions. 

Opentrons’ robotics are in use in over 40 countries around the world and have been adopted by top-tier institutions like Stanford, Harvard, Merck, and Roche. Opentrons is VC-backed with investors including Khosla Ventures, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, and Y Combinator.

Who We Are:

Stateless is on a mission to reinvent network connectivity. Central to that was our initial innovation, where we demonstrated an ability to efficiently decouple state from processing in network functions—a task deemed infeasible in high-performance networking systems, but in doing so, we have opened the door for fundamentally changing how networks are built. Now, we are building the product around that vision. VCs have backed us and customers are validating the business opportunity.

Stateless lives at the intersection of distributed systems and software defined networking; two fields with immense potential and a laundry list of novel challenges. This is your chance to join a team leading the revolution! But it is not "just implementation". Stateless is a leading-edge company utilizing innovative technologies and tools. We are always open to what's coming next and in many cases defining what's coming next.

That's where you come in.

What you will do:

As a frontend engineer you will be responsible for the implementation of the user interface for the Stateless platform. At Stateless, we make complex networks simple to manage and we believe our frontend should present the user with simple, intuitive interfaces. High quality user interfaces are a major deficiency in current networking systems so your work will be a key differentiator for our product and essential to the success of the platform.

You will spend time building requirements with the product team, collaborating with designers, and developing API specifications with the backend team. While you do not need to be an expert in backend technology, an understanding of servers, distributed systems and networking will be valuable in your work here, as will some backend development skills to work alongside the frontend team.

To be successful in this role you will need:

Experience with modern frontend JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks such as Vue or React
Experience with frontend automated testing tools, such as Jest/Mocha/Chai and DOM Testing Library
Experience with HTML and CSS, SASS, or LESS
The desire to work with other teams on designing and improving our RESTful APIs

These are nice to have:

Experience working in an agile environment
Experience working with product owners to design a UI that is both beautiful and highly usable
Docker or equivalent containerization technology
OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specification experience
Experience defining and maintaining CI/CD pipelines
Experience with NodeJS
Experience with configuring enterprise networking equipment

Why Stateless?

At Stateless you will make an impact right out of the gate. As a company we are challenging the status quo and as a culture we do the same. We stand for a culture in which we are SUPPORTIVE of one another and committed to team diversity, SINCERE in our communication with our colleagues and customers, STUDIOUS in the way we are serious about and accountable for our work, always STRIVING to improve, and ultimately STATELESS where we are willing to adapt as needed.

We take care of you here at Stateless.

Salary range: $115,000 - $150,000 per year depending on experience
Stock options
Remote working
Unlimited PTO
100% of premiums covered for our base level healthcare plan as well as dental and vision for you and your immediate family members.
Optional FSA, HSA, and 401K participation.

Stateless is a Techstars Boulder company with strong venture funding.

This is your opportunity to join a highly collaborative environment as part of an innovative, tight-knit team of talented individuals bringing an amazing new product to market. We are already well on our way and are navigating deep into uncharted networking waters. Please think about joining Stateless on this transformational networking journey!
