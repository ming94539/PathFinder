--Scraper.py--
Instead of printing to results.txt, scrape_linkedin() returns its result for use in Selenium_Navigation.py

--Selenium_Navigation.py--
Organized code into functions
Avoids scraping duplicate job listing if job_id already exists in db (uses table "Test" for now)
Takes in list of search terms from job_list (added 'Data Analyst' for testing and reduced number of listings scraped to 5 from 10) 

--clearTable.py--
For testing only; clear or view contents of table in db

Other notes:
This might be because i've been running the program on windows, but I'm getting errors when pages are being scraped, and the program crashes entirely when around 5-7 job descriptions have been scraped in a row. If this doesn't happen for you guys, this can be disregarded.
