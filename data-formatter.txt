How to Use:

test-data-formatter.py is just the python file version of data-formatter-dev.ipynb (the Jupiter notebook used in development stage) that's cleaned up.

@Input: A text file containing several job post descriptions each are separated by a line
Containing "BREAK[job id]", the [job id] will be used for the output. Look at sample_jobposts.txt for example.

Note: ALL job posts in the input text file should all belong to the SAME job title search term. For example, all job posts description in the text file should belong to "Web Developer" or "Front End Developer",etc..., can't have more than one job title in the input file due to how this module is designed. 

@Output:  
The code will return a long dictionary of the result of data extraction. I also let it print it to console.

template = {'4385545':{'skills':{'javascript, python, angular'}, 
                       'industries':['healthcare','telecommunication'],
                       'degree_level':{'bachelor','master'},
		       'languages':['javascript','python']
                       'seniority':'Senior',
                       'yoe':5,
                       'degree_title':{'ce','cs'}
                      },
            '5345465':{
                ....
            }
           }
Attributes:
'skills': used a set() data structure instead of list to deal with repeats

'industries': used a set() data structure instead of list to deal with repeats. The standardized industries can be found in linkedin_industries.txt (146 industries)

'degree_level': used set(). 'a' - associates 'b'-bachelors 'm' - masters 'p' - phd 

'seniority': just a string from one of the standardized LinkedIn terms: ['Internship','Entry level','Associate','Mid-Senior level','Director','Executive']
And "N/A" when don't have this seniority attribute or have something not one of the above terms (shouldn't be possible, unless LinkedIn is inconsistent which does happen surprisingly) 

yoe: 	
Just an int. Returns -1 when can't find this attribute.

degree_title:
Return set. So far are just 'computer science', etc. haven't expanded to anything else yet like  math, applied math, bioinformatics, statistics, etc. since I need to add more error handling for these new ones as these terms might not be used in context of education level.

Design choices:
1. Abbreviation - B.A. B.S. - after my punctuation remover, it becomes B A B S. Making it miss stuff, handled this by just adding 'b a' 'b s' to the list
2. Tokenization - Miss key words with two or more words like "React Native", so just stopped using tokenization and used "if 'react native' in text' 
3. Double spaces - not completely sure yet but I think it's from the punctuation remover, but the regex that removes multiple consecutive spaces can deal with that

Future Scaling Ideas:
1. Skim job description to just requirements, preferred req, and education. Makes things faster and less error prone (keywords won't get detected in the description part instead of requirements).
This would require a very comprehensive list of variations of 'education','qualification' , "we would like to see", "what u should have" etc. 
2. Handle more types of degree titles, might need to search through just the education section
